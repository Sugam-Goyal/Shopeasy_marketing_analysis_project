- Fact_Engagement_Data: Captures customer interactions with marketing content (blogs, social media, videos), including views, clicks, and likes.
- Fact_Customer_Journey: Tracks each customer’s journey through different stages (homepage, productpage, checkout) and actions (view, click, purchase, drop-off).
- Fact_Customer_Reviews: Stores customer ratings (1-5) for various products.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of findings
1.  Conversion rate
- The overall conversion rate from Jan 2023 to Dec 2025 stands at 5.04%.
- Notable peaks were observed in Jan 2023, Jan 2024, and Sep 2025. A sharp decline was recorded in July 2025 (1.65%), but conversion rates have since shown signs of recovery.

2. Customer Engagement
- Engagement (views, clicks, and likes) has steadily declined since Jan 2023.
- A slight resurgence began in Sep 2025, but engagement levels remain significantly lower than in 2023.
- The long-term decline suggests a drop in customer interest or reduced marketing effectiveness.

3. Customer Rating
- The average customer rating over the period is 3.69, fluctuating between 3.3 and 4.1.
- While relatively stable, consistently high ratings (4.0+) have been less frequent, indicating room for improvement in customer satisfaction.
